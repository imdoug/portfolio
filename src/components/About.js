                             I have a vast curiosity and appreciation for the challenge
                              of designing software that can enrich peoplesâ€™ lives.
                               I am eager to join a software engineering team that will
                                synthesize my capacity to work with others and my new
                                 toolkit in JavaScript, Python, React, SQL and Express.
                                  My immediate goal is to join a value-based company as
                                   a junior full-stack developer where I can hone my skills
                                    and pursue my interests in automation and OOP. I want
                                     to build applications to serve and meet the needs of 
                                     those who want to enter the tech space.
